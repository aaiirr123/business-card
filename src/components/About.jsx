            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am a computer engineering student from the University 
                of central Florida.
            </p>
            <p>I have interned at both Amazon and Leidos 
                and have gained experience in both software 
                engineering and DevOps.
            </p>

            <p>
                Computer science and software engineering are 
                things I never would have imagined being able 
                succeed at a few years ago, but here I 
                am!
            </p>
